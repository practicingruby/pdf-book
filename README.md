# Creating PDF in Ruby

This repository contains code samples that will eventually become part of the
"Creating PDF in Ruby" book. Each example models a practical PDF generation
use case, implemented using the Prawn PDF toolkit.

## Project overview

Our goal is to produce roughly a dozen different use cases, each of which
will demonstrate different Prawn features and document generation techniques.

So far, the following use cases have been implemented:

* Dynamic form letters (see `examples/form_letter`)
* Utility bill (see `examples/utility_bill` )

For a list of use cases we're interested in covering but have not implemented
yet, see `IDEAS.md`.
