Dear <%= customer_name %>,

It's that time of year again and in order to assist you in gathering
the necessary records needed to prepare your <%= year %> tax returns,
we have compiled the enclosed checklist for you to complete.

Just a reminder, your <%= year %> returns must be electronically filed
as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Also, our fee is expected to be
paid at the time your tax return is completed. <strong>Our fee must be paid
before your return can be filed. For your convenience, we accept credit
cards.</strong>

If you receive a refund we recommend that you have it direct deposited. This
results in a quicker and safer way to receive your refund. Please complete and
return the enclosed information and return it to us when you send in your tax
information.

When you send in your information, also give us your email address if you have
one so that we may contact you should we need any additional information. Also,
please let us know if you would like to pick up your return when it is completed
or if you would like it mailed to you.

Please send in your information before <%= deadline %>. If we receive your
information after that date, there is no guarantee that your returns will be
processed by the tax filing deadline and an extension will be filed for you.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call,
or email us at:
